```

Use `/test` for convenient test running with options.

## Commits

Short description only. No "Generated by" or "Co-Authored-By" lines.

## Architecture

Converts CadQuery B-Rep CAD objects to PyTorch Geometric heterogeneous graphs.

**Pipeline:** `topology.py` → `geometry.py` → `features.py` → `converter.py`

**Key Design:** NURBS control points are graph nodes (not padded tensors) with `controls` edges to parent curves/surfaces.

**OCP Note:** Iterate `TopTools_ListOfShape` with Python protocol (`for item in list`), not `list.Value(i)`.
